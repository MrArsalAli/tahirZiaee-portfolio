Project Script: Designer + UI/UX One Page Website
Theme Direction :A dark, ultra-modern portfolio experience for a graphic designer & UI/UX artist that makes users feel motion, creativity, and intelligence in every scroll.
Each section should flow like a story — not just blocks of content.
Design Language :Theme: Dark Futuristic
Primary Color: #0DA2E7 (Electric Cyan-Blue)
Secondary Shades:Deep Matte Black: #0A0A0A
Soft Neon Glow: #00D1FF
Accent Violet (for depth): #B500F1
Typography: Use a rare futuristic font with minimalist lines but solid readability.
Suggested font: “Neue Machina” (by Pangram Pangram) — it gives that “AI meets design” energy.
Alternate: “Satoshi Variable” or “Inter Tight” (if you want lighter edges).
Font Pairing:
Headings: Neue Machina Bold
Body: Satoshi Regular
Important Implementation Rule:
Do NOT add unnecessary React libraries.
Only use Framer Motion, GSAP, or native CSS animations.
Keep components modular and lightweight — no UI kits, no dependencies, no distractions.
Focus purely on performance, scroll experience, and storytelling transitions.
Page Structure + Section Breakdown
Hero Section — “The Creative Pulse”
Full 100vh section, pitch black background.
Centered designer name (white text with electric blue glow).
Subheading fades in below:
“Design is not what it looks like — it’s how it feels to move through it.”
Subtle animation: blue neon lines move behind the text like slow digital energy waves.
Cursor trail effect — when user moves cursor, a tiny electric spark follows.
Scroll down trigger: page shifts smoothly with parallax depth.
About Section — “The Mind Behind the Interface”
Split section (left = abstract portrait image with grain texture, right = text).
When scrolled into view, text slides in with Framer Motion.
Use soft cyan gradient behind text, with low opacity.
Text sample:
“I’m a UI/UX designer obsessed with clarity and creative depth.
From clean app layouts to bold product stories — I turn pixels into emotions.”
Add small highlight blocks (Skills, Tools, Experience) that fade in one by one.
Showcase Section — “Work That Speaks”
Grid layout: 3 columns, full-width view.
Each project tile = glassmorphic card (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)), with glowing borders.
On hover:
Slight scale up.
Title and tags appear from bottom.
Blue glow border animates around image edges.
Between every column, a thin vertical neon divider line glows softly.
background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent, #0DA2E7, transparent);
width: 1px;
Keep height balanced (~90vh total) so user sees a cinematic layout — no white gaps.
Interaction Section — “The Creative Experience”
Add an interactive parallax:
Floating SVG elements (brush strokes, geometric shapes, design tools) move slowly as user scrolls.
Optional: Mouse-based tilt effect on the entire section (subtle).
Text:
“Design is alive when you can feel its rhythm. Every scroll is a frame — every frame tells a story.”
Contact / Footer — “Let’s Create the Future”
Full-width, minimal footer.
Background: gradient from deep black → electric blue.
Text center-aligned:
“Ready to collaborate?” in light gray
Email link in bright blue with hover underline animation.
Small tagline at bottom:
“© 2025 Crafted and Built by AA.”
Floating glowing line animation looping behind the footer as background motion.
Bonus Micro-Interactions
Scroll reveal: use framer-motion fade + slide for each section.
Text shimmer: on hover, text glows briefly with a pulse.
Smooth scroll snapping: make transitions feel cinematic, not abrupt.
Favicon + loading screen: animated logo reveal with blue light streak.
Tech Stack Recommendation
Frontend: React + Vite (fast build)
Animation: GSAP ScrollTrigger / Framer Motion
Styling: TailwindCSS + custom CSS variables for glow & blur
